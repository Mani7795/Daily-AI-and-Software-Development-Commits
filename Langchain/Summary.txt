"Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli must return from retirement to save Indian Test cricket. This is not the time to think about themselves - it's about the nation, the fans, and the deep emotions people have for the game. Virat still has at least ten years of cricket left in him. As for Rohit, if he comes to me, I will make sure he gets back in peak fitness," Yograj told IANS on Tuesday.

The veteran cricketer said the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) must support players during their tough times so that players don't bow down to mounting pressure.

"Back in 2011, players like Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, and Virender Sehwag were dropped without any clear reason. When Yuvraj retired, I scolded him - I told him not to give in to pressure. He was, and still is, incredibly fit. Cricketers should fight for their place in the team instead of surrendering to external pressures.

"The BCCI must act like a parent - protect and support their players, not let ego or politics dictate decisions," he added.
