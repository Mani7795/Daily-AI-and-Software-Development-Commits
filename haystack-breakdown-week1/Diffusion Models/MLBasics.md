# Basics in Machine learning and its definitions 
## scikit learn
Few Apis include: fit(), transform(), predict(). This package is one of the most powerful and basic machine learning algorithms 

## Pytorch Vs TensorFlow

For Research & Flexibility → PyTorch
  
For Production & Scalability → TensorFlow
  
For Beginners → Start with PyTorch (easier debugging)
  
For Enterprise/Cloud → TensorFlow (better tooling)   
  
### Pytorch
__init__ initializes object state. __self__ refers to the instance
